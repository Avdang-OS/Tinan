if you're gonna rewrite it, then I don't know what will happen and how will we do it
it's like i don't know how the hell will we write another command handler or just yoink it from here
same goes to event handler but you dont like it :skull: so it wont be included there maybe

Bot
  .command("loa")
  .handler(loaHandler);

for (const {name, handler} of commandHandlers) {
  Bot
    .command(name)
    .handler(handler);
}

for (const {regex, reaction} of reactions) {
  Bot
    .message(regex)
    .react(reaction);
}

Bot
  .message(/akane/i)
  .react("🅰️🇰🇦🇳🇪🐱");
